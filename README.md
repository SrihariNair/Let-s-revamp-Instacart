# **Project Rationale**

Instacart's existing platform faces significant issues with a cluttered homepage, lackluster notifications, and an overall lack of reminders that fail to engage users effectively. The objective of this revamp is to address these shortcomings by simplifying the user interface and introducing engaging, personalized features that enhance the user experience.

## **Why This Revamp is Necessary**

- **Cluttered Homepage**: The current homepage is overloaded with options which complicates the shopping process. Simplifying this into a more streamlined, personalized homepage will enhance user navigation and satisfaction.
- **Ineffective Notifications**: Current notifications lack personalization and impact, resulting in low engagement rates. By introducing quirky, contextually relevant notifications, we aim to significantly enhance user interaction and retention.
- **Lack of Reminders**: The existing system does not effectively remind users to revisit the app, which can lead to reduced usage. Implementing effective reminder systems will help increase frequency of use.

Provides convenient pre-portioned gourmet to-cook meal solutions, allowing customers to enjoy high-quality home cooking without the hassle of meal planning and grocery shopping.
